# microPlastics

Look into disabling terminal until stir/shake needs input

The sizes for microplastics and polymers were incorrect, polymers are much larger than microplastics.

When we switched them, the force functions now do not work as they are supposed to, so we need to figure that out

We should be getting measurements sent again, we need to convert those and add the new measurements tot he simulation
